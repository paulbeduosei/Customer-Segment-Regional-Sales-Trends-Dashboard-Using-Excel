📌 Business Problem

A retail client needed a simple but powerful way to understand:

How order volumes change over time

The goal was to provide clear insights without requiring technical expertise.

🧠 Process & Methodology

1. Data Preparation

Reviewed raw sales data for inconsistencies

Verified date formats, categories, and segments

Ensured clean inputs for accurate reporting

2. Pivot Table Analysis

Pivot tables were created to summarize:

Order volume by category and time

Revenue by customer segment and region

Performance comparisons across states

Why: Pivot tables allow fast aggregation and flexible analysis without hard-coding formulas.

3. Trend Analysis

Line charts were built to track order volumes over time

Categories were compared side-by-side

Why: Time-based trends reveal seasonality, growth patterns, and declines.

4. Segment & Regional Analysis

Bar charts compare Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office sales

Regional differences are highlighted clearly

Why: Understanding who buys and where helps guide marketing, pricing, and inventory decisions.

5. Interactive Dashboard Design

Slicers added for date, state, category, and segment

Clean layout focused on clarity and usability

Why: Stakeholders can explore insights without modifying the file or using formulas.
